Application Type:

This is a software application.
Application Purpose:

It serves a basic or fundamental purpose.
Frontend Technology:

The user interface of the application is created using HTML. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating web pages.
Backend Technology:

The server-side logic of the application is implemented using Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server.
Database:

The application uses a PostgreSQL database for storing and managing data. PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system.
Docker Usage:

Docker is used in this project. Docker is a platform that allows you to package and distribute applications and their dependencies in containers, which can run consistently across different environments.
Docker Compose:

A Docker Compose file is provided. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define the services, networks, and volumes for your application in a single YAML file, making it easier to manage complex setups.
PostgreSQL as a Docker Container:

The PostgreSQL database is set up to run as a Docker container. This means that the database is isolated in its own container, making it easier to manage and deploy as part of the application stack.
In summary, this is a simple web application with an HTML frontend, a Node.js backend, and a PostgreSQL database. It's packaged using Docker, and a Docker Compose file is provided to help with the deployment and management of the application and its dependencies. This setup can be useful for creating a consistent development and deployment environment for the application.
